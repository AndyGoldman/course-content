# JavaScript Frameworks

The JavaScript development scene is becoming increasingly complicated given the
number of new projects that are starting up every day. Many of these seek to
address some of the underlying shortcomings of JavaScript and improve
developer productivity.

## Assessing Third-Party Projects

If you're playing around with code, there is a lot of freedom when working with
other projects. However, for production code and projects, it is essential to
exersize some restraint in choosing tools that will add benefits without
causing more pain in the future

* How active is the project? - not just recently, but over a sustained period of
  time
* Examine the developer and support community
* What does the documentation look like?
* Are there significant contributors and users?
