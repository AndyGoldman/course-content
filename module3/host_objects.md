# Host Objects

In addition to the *native objects* defined by the language specification
(Object, Array, Date, etc), JavaScript runtime environments provide a default
set of *host objects* that allow code to interact with the environment.

## Browser Objects

The JavaScript runtime environment provides several global object references
that provide access to various aspects of the browser environment your code is
running within.

Each runtime provides a different set of objects, but for the most part you'll
be running within a web browser and work with the global objects defined there.

### The window Object

window.ready

### The document Object

### The navigator Object
