# Object Modeling Practice

The following are some simple scenarios for you to come up with a data model
in JavaScript to represent a set of information.

For each scenario, consider:

* What basic information needs to be captured?
* How will that information be used, and does that affect how it should be
  modeled?
* Are there alternative ways of representing the information, and what are
  the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?

## Vehicle Information

Create an object that represents basic information about a vehicle, such as
make, model, color, etc.

```javascript.interactive
```

## Recipe List

How would you represent a list of recipes for an application? Start by modeling
the recipe itself first, and then consider how to maintain a list of recipes
for the user.

```javascript.interactive
```

## Tic Tac Toe Game

You need to write a game that plays tic tac toe with the user. How do you
represent the current game state in code?

```javascript.interactive
```

## Photo Catalog Organization

What information is needed to maintain a catalog of photos you have taken.
Consider recording:

* Camera information
* Location, time, and associated event
* How to tag and organize the photos

```javascript.interactive
```

## League Schedule

You are working on a project to create a scheduling program for a soccer league.
How would you maintain the list of games between teams?

```javascript.interactive
```
